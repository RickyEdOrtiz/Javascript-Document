      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for<br> example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.<br>
        <br>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,<br> control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for<br> example:
        
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).<br> For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as<br> mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,<br> server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to<br> another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul> 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="What_you_should_already_know">
      <h1>What you should already know</h1>
      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Javascript_and_java">
    <h1>Javascript and Java</h1>
    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does<br> not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic<br> control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of<br> data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common<br> class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.<br> JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely<br> typed methods.<br>
      <br>
      JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have<br> to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters,<br> and function return types are not explicitly typed.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Hello_world">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
      <div class="Example"><p>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }<br>
        greetMe("World");</p></div>
        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Variables">
      <h1>Variables</h1>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.<br>
        <br>
        A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because<br> JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).<br>
        <br>
        You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in<br> identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.  
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Declaring_variables">
      <h1>Declaring Variables</h1>
      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:<br>
        <br>
        With the keyword var. For example,<br></p>
        <div class="Example"><p>var x = 42.</p></div>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.<br>
          <br>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example,<br>
      </p>
      <div class="Example"><p>x = 42.</p></div>
      <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.<br>
        <br>
        With the keyword let. For example,<br></p>
        <div class="Example">let y = 13.</div>
        <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Variable_scope">
      <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
      <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current<br> document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.<br>
        <br>
        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function<br> (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global<br> context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
        <div class="Example"><p>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</p></div>
        <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
        <div class="Example"><p>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is<br>
          not defined</p></div>
    </div>
    <div id="Global_variables">
      <h1>Global Variables</h1>
      <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global<br> variables using the window.variable syntax.<br>
        <br>
        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or<br> frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as<br> parent.phoneNumber.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Constants">
      <h1>Constants</h1>
      <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier:<br> it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
       <br>
       <div class="Example"><p>const PI = 3.14;</p></div>
       <br>
       <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.<br>
      <br>
      The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to <br>represent a variable.<br>
    <br>
    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:<br>
    <br></p> 
    <div class="Example"><p>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS<br>
      <br>WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;<br>
      <br>//statements }</p></div>
      <br>
      <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p><br>
      <div class="Example"><p>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =<br>
        <br>"otherValue";</p></div>
    </div>
    <div id="DataTypes">
      <h1>Data Types</h1>
      <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p><br>
      <ul id="bulletDot">
        <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
      </ul>
      <ul id="circleDot" style="list-style-type:circle">
        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
        <br>
        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
        <br>
        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
        <br>
        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
        <br>
        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul id="bulletDot">
        <li>and Object</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and<br> functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as<br> procedures that your application can perform.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="ifElse">
      <h1>if...else statement</h1>
      <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is<br> false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
      <br>
      <div class="Example">
        <p>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If<br> condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any<br> statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
      <br>
      <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
      <br>
      <div class="Example">
        <p>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {<br>
          statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {<br>
          statement_last; }</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements,<br> group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if<br> statements:</p>
      <br>
      <div class="Example">
        <p>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;<br>
          statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {<br>
          statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;<br>
          statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when<br> glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
      <br>
      <div class="Example">
        <p>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For<br> example:</p>
      <br>
      <div class="Example">
        <p>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</p>
      </div>
      <div id="while">
        <h1>While statements</h1>
        <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
        <br>
        <div class="Example">
          <p>while (condition) statement</p>
        </div>
        <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.<br>
          <br>
          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is<br> tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.<br>
          <br>
          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.<br>
          <br>
          Example:<br>
          <br>
          The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
          <div class="Example">
            <p>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</p>
          </div>
          <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
            <br>
            <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
            <br>
            <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="functions">
        <h1>Function Declarations</h1>
        <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <br>
          <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
          <br>
          <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
        <div class="Example">
          <p>function square(number) { return number * number; }</p>
        </div>
        <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the<br> function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
        <div class="Example">
          <p>return number * number;</p>
        </div>
        <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the<br> value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="reference">
